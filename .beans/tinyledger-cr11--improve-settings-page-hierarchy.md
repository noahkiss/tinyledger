Settings page has six peer-level card sections all with equal visual weight: Appearance, main settings form, Tags link, Recurring link, Import/Export, and App Installation. The most important settings (name, type) compete visually with installation instructions.

Consider:
- Grouping related sections (Tags + Recurring could be a subsection of the main form)
- Reducing visual weight of secondary sections (App Installation, Import/Export) — lighter borders, smaller headings, or collapsible
- Making the primary settings form the clear focal point
