Three chart containers on the reports page are identical: same rounded-xl, same border, same padding, same size stacked vertically. This creates a flat, monotone layout where no chart feels more important than another.

Consider:
- Making the Net Income chart (primary insight) wider or more prominent
- Using a 2-column grid for the secondary charts (Income vs Expense + Spending Breakdown)
- Strengthening the "Financial Overview" section header as a visual break between summary cards and charts
