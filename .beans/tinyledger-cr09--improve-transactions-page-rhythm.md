The transactions page uses uniform `space-y-4` gaps between all sections (action buttons, summary header, filter bar, timeline). Everything is the same width and density — no breathing room. The filter bar is the densest element but gets the same spacing as the airy action buttons.

Consider:
- Increasing gap before the timeline section to visually separate controls from content
- Reducing gap between the summary header and filter bar (they're related controls)
- Slightly varying section widths or padding to create rhythm
