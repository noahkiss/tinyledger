# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-03
**Phases:** 1-9 (+ 7.1 inserted)
**Total Plans:** 29

## Overview

TinyLedger delivers a lightweight, mobile-first ledger for sole proprietors in 9 phases. The journey starts with workspace isolation and core database infrastructure (foundation), builds up transaction entry with tags and attachments (the daily workflow), then adds fiscal year navigation and timeline views. Reporting and tax calculations follow, culminating in mobile polish and Docker deployment. Every phase delivers observable user value while respecting the dependency chain: workspace isolation enables everything, tags with allocation enable accurate reporting, attachments enable receipt counts in reports, and reports enable tax calculations.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 7.1: Filings (inserted after Phase 7 for compliance filing tracking)

**Key Decisions:**
- sv create CLI instead of deprecated create-svelte
- Tailwind v4 via Vite plugin, no PostCSS configuration
- Workspace-isolated SQLite with connection caching
- Integer cents for currency (avoid floating-point)
- Dual ID system (id for FKs, publicId for URLs)
- Void-first deletion model for audit compliance
- microfuzz for lightweight fuzzy search
- Sharp re-encoding for attachment security
- Chart.js direct integration with $effect lifecycle
- rrule for standard recurring patterns
- VACUUM INTO for safe SQLite backups

**Issues Resolved:**
- All 79 requirements implemented
- Cross-phase integration verified
- 8 E2E user flows working

**Issues Deferred:**
- TAXC-02 partial: Outside earnings calculator (bracket picker sufficient)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- 6 orphaned helper exports (utility functions for future use)
- Phase 1 missing formal VERIFICATION.md
