# Phase 7.1 Plan 02: Filings Tab UI Summary

**Card-based Filings tab with status sorting (past-due first), mark/unmark complete workflow, and navigation for both workspace types**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T15:19:22Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T15:27:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- FilingCard component with status colors (green/red/yellow) and inline mark complete form
- Filings page loads applicable filings by workspace type/state, sorted by urgency
- Taxes page simplified to calculations only with "View Filings" link
- Navigation updated to show Filings tab for both sole_prop and volunteer_org workspaces

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create FilingCard component** - `fe20a02` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create Filings page server and UI** - `80de3fd` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Update Taxes page and layout navigation** - `7ac67e0` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/lib/components/FilingCard.svelte` - Reusable card with status colors, mark complete form, unmark action (193 lines)
- `src/routes/w/[workspace]/filings/+page.server.ts` - Load filings, markComplete/unmarkComplete actions (182 lines)
- `src/routes/w/[workspace]/filings/+page.svelte` - Grid layout with FY picker, status summary (112 lines)
- `src/routes/w/[workspace]/taxes/+page.svelte` - Removed quarterly payments section, added Filings link
- `src/routes/w/[workspace]/+layout.svelte` - Added Filings tab for all workspace types

## Decisions Made
- **Filings visible to all workspaces:** Both sole_prop and volunteer_org see Filings tab (different filings per type)
- **Tab order:** Transactions | Reports | Taxes (sole_prop only) | Filings
- **Status colors:** Inherited from existing quarterly payments (green=complete, red=past-due, yellow=upcoming)
- **Taxes page link:** Includes FY param to preserve context when navigating
