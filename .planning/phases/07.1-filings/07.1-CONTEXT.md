# Phase 7.1: Filings - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Dedicated Filings tab for tracking compliance filing deadlines and completion status. Works for both workspace types (sole_prop and volunteer_org). Migrates quarterly payment tracking and tax forms reference from Taxes page, which will link here for filing details.

## Implementation Decisions

### Migration from Taxes page
- Quarterly Payments section moves to Filings tab
- Tax Forms Reference expands into full filing tracking
- Taxes page keeps calculation breakdowns, adds link to Filings tab for tracking
- Inherit existing status colors: green=paid, red=past-due, yellow=upcoming

### Layout and organization
- Card-based layout (matching existing quarterly payment style)
- Unified list of all filings (quarterly + annual) sorted by deadline
- Grouped by status: past-due pinned to top (with red styling), then upcoming, then completed
- Detailed cards showing: form name, deadline, status, description, filing instructions link
- Follows FY picker in header (consistent with other views)

### Completion workflow
- Expandable form when marking complete (matches quarterly payment pattern)
- Fields captured: date filed (defaults to today), confirmation number (optional), notes (optional)
- Confirmation dialog required before marking complete
- Unmark also requires confirmation (symmetric with mark)

### Form coverage - Sole Proprietor
- Federal quarterly: 4 separate cards for Q1-Q4 1040-ES (each with own deadline)
- Federal annual: Schedule C, Schedule SE
- State: Auto-populated based on configured state (PA = PA-40 ES quarterlies, etc.)

### Form coverage - Volunteer Organization
- 990-N only for v1 (most small volunteer orgs use e-Postcard)
- State registration forms based on configured state

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact PA state filing requirements (research which forms are typical)
- Card styling details and spacing
- How to handle edge cases (new workspace mid-year, etc.)
- Filing instructions link sources

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "Some of this is lift & shift from Taxes page with reference links back"
- Taxes page should link to Filings for "track your filings here" - keep Taxes focused on calculations
- Status color pattern already established and should remain consistent

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- 990-EZ support for larger volunteer orgs — future enhancement
- Custom filing entries (user-defined forms) — future enhancement
- Auto-detection of which 990 form based on revenue thresholds — future enhancement

</deferred>
